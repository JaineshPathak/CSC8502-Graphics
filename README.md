# CSC8502 - Elden Ring Theme

A part of CSC8502 Coursework, Newcastle University. NCLGL library framework was provided by the University. The task was to make an Elden Ring style level in OpenGL and C++.

I exported the meshes with animations from Unity to the .msh format accepted by NCLGL library framework.
The framework was provided by Rich Davison.

# Source Code Files to look at
The main sourse code is inside the "Blank Project" folder (sorry for misleading name). The rest of the folder are tutorials provided by University.

# How to Run?

OR
